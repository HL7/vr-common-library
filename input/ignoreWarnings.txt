# This is an internal NCHS Code system that is not used as part of FHIR-based exchange.  Mappings are provided to ease transition from legacy systems.
The Source Code System CodeSystemIJEVitalRecords is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples


# This is a publisher induced issue.   The extension in question is introduced by the publisher, not sushi.   See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher 
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)
