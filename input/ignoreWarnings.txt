# Can't validate code system....no action required
The definition for the Code System with URI 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated

# This is an internal NCHS Code system that is not used as part of FHIR-based exchange.  Mappings are provided to ease transition from legacy systems.
The Source Code System CodeSystemIJEVitalRecords is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed


# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# This is not relevant for our application
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have an effective[x] ()

# This is a publisher induced issue.   The extension in question is introduced by the publisher, not sushi.   See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher 
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# Unknown internal code system IJE
	The Source Code System IJE is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# Best practice for Vital Stats?
Constraint failed: con-3: 'Condition.clinicalStatus SHALL be present if verificationStatus is not entered-in-error and category is problem-list-item' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Condition) (Best Practice Recommendation)
