####  January 2024 Ballot of STU2

This STU2 ballot addresses the following:

- Reorganization of vital-records related content and harmonization to reduce redunancy and near redundancy. See [Vital Records IG Harmonization](vr_ig_harmonization.html).
- This reorganization and harmonization includes
  - Addition of profiles supporting NCHS-standard submission of race and ethnicity inputs, and return of coded race and ethnicity.
  - Inclusion of extensions used by multiple vital-records related FHIR IGs (e.g., partial dates)
  - Movement of content (i.e., profiles, valuesets, examples) that is used exclusively in the birth and fetal death use cases to the Birth and Fetal Death Reporting IG.  As a result, the total content of this IG has seeminly shrunk.
  - Inclusion of valuesets formerly hosted in PHINVADs.  This follows the pattern established by the VRDR IG.

  For a description of the changes to VRCL from STU1.1, see the [Change table](tbd.html).
