Implementors are free to use the coded fields with the defined valuesets for inter-jurisdictional exchange, 
but coded values are not expected for vital records submissions. 

Note that the coded industry and occupation fields are bound to PHINVADs-hosted value sets. 

For NCHS provided coded values the specific vocabulary used will depend on the death year.
